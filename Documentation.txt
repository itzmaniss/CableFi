Fixed the bug i faced with add() --> i was missing a '' in the query. NOTE : when using where after '=' the variable must be inside ''

for update()
- made udpate(), was relatively easy once i figured what was wrong with add() --> yet to check  -->Tested workss
- changed update to be more logicall
- i put update to increase or decrease by a value.. why would i do that?! 
- luckily i realised how dumb that was and changed it to update to set quantity
- realising i should be deleting if quantity is set to 0 BRB --> DONE

for cart()
- started off slow, procrastinanted a while, very little comparitively 
- completed cart() with ease
- however i had an intermediate thought process --> price in sql should be total not for single piece 
if note it will be a hassle to deal with while displaying cart --> to implement later 
- yet to start on html for this page. should be more competetive than other pages as ill be traversing into
jinja codes, which i have mostly avoided 

- did my html. Yes its plain but it took a while for me to understand what i had to do 
and so i am proud of the page. What more do people want from cart anyways?
- However i am facing an error 404. Tryna find out where it is occuring and hopefully fix it. Pls dont take long
- FIXED wrong name in html jinja.

Did some code to import price of individual items from database.
Decided to import everything at the start and keep as a dictionary. 

YET TO DO:
- I want to change cart database to state total price instead of individual price
- Name all the products i want to sell in a dictionary with the value as price. -> use this to upload into 
database later on.

Thats all for today i guess. Alr 9pm and super tired.
